ShanAI is an intelligent assistant built as a personal project to demonstrate advanced AI integration within a portfolio platform. Developed using Flask for backend architecture and Jupyter Notebook for experimentation and prototyping, it leverages large language models and OpenAI APIs to facilitate dynamic user interactions. This project showcases the practical application of conversational AI, highlighting skills in API integration, backend development, and AI-driven design thinkingâ€”all packaged within a clean, responsive portfolio layout that reflects innovation and technical expertise.

If you'd like, I can tailor this further for a resume, LinkedIn profile, or portfolio card layout. Just say the word!
